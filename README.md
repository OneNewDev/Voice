=======================

This is my digital playground where I am learning. I'm integrating and validating new technologies and ideas here, playing around with new UI / UX components and developing with the best coding standard I come up with.

At the same time I want to provide an audiobook player which is really easy in use and a joy to work with.

If you like to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md#development) or [translate](CONTRIBUTING.md#translations), that is very much appreciated.
